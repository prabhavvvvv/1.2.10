# Mad Libs Generator (1.2.10)

## Team Members: Aryaman, Prabhav, and Vijayesh
 
## Overview
We created a MadLibs generator in Java. We built this using:
 - input handling with scanner
 - Concatenation
 - Modular programming with functions
 - Clear flow of the program

This program takes YOUR input of various nouns, adjectives, and verbs and inserts those into a premade story template to create a more funny, personalized story.
