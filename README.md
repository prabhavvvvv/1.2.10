# Mad Libs Generator
## Overview
We created a MadLibs generator in Java. We built this using:
 - input handling with scanner
 - Concatenation
 - Modular programming with functions
 - Clear flow of the program

This program takes YOUR input of various nouns, adjectives, and verbs and inserts those into a premade story template to create a more funny, personalized story. We also added a function to add the proper use of vowels in the MadLibs sentence.
